# Hand-Written-Digit-Predicting-Model
We are given a csv file which contains the pixels of images of hand written digits. We are predicting the hand written digits images which are converted to the pixels and stored in the csv file with the help of numpy array and prediction is done using the KNN algorithm.
The prediction is done on random pixels from the test data file and pixels are plotted with help of matplotlib.pyplot module.

### Libraries Used:-
1. Pandas
2. Random
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib.pyplot
